## üñ• Conse

Conse is an AI based Crypto Game Event Manager Platform on top of [coiniXerr](https://github.com/wildonion/uniXerr/tree/master/infra/valhalla/coiniXerr) and Solana blockchain. 

## üß™ Test Conse Hyper Server

```cargo test --bin conse```

## üèÉ Run Conse Hyper Server

```cargo run --bin conse```

## üõ†Ô∏è Production Setup

> First run ```sudo chmod +x deploy.sh && ./deploy.sh``` to setup the VPS for production then to update a user access level to dev first signup the user using `/auth/signup` API then run the binary server like so: `./cosne wildonion 0` or `cargo run --bin conse wildonion 0` finally login with dev user to register a new god for the game.

## üçü Notes

* in order to use docker containers inside another one by its DNS name, all of them must be inside the same network bridge.

* build the docker image from the `gem` server only (without `docker-compose`), using ```sudo docker build -t gem . && sudo docker -d run gem```. 

* clean docker cache using ```sudo docker buildx prune --all``` command.

* register push notification strategy: client `<--hyper REST-->` register a push notif route using redis client `<--REDIS SERVER-->` register pubsub topic (emit events) on redis server.

* subscribing to push notification strategy: client `<--gql subscription-->` redis published topics (emitted events) inside the server.

* subscribing to realtiming chat strategy: client `<--gql subscription ws-->` hyper gql ws server contains redis and mongodb clients setup `<--REDIS & MONGODB SERVER-->` store data on redis for caching and persistence in mongodb.

* remember to fill the `OPENAI_KEY` and `DISCORD_TOKEN` variables with your credentials inside the `.env` file.

* with [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1092048595605270589&permissions=277025475584&scope=bot%20applications.commands) we can add the conse bot to discord servers.  

## üöß WIP

* setup **TLS** using `tokio-rustls` or noise protocol for `hyper` and `ws` server in code also setup it up inside the `HAproxy` configuration file using the `conse_cert.pem` and `conse_key.pem` inside the `devops/openssl/` folder.

* `ed25519` keypair for server checksum, verification using its commit (like ssh) and **SSL/TLS** certificate, updating app and time hash based locking api using `argon2`, `rust-crypto`, `noise`, `ring` and `ed25519-dalek` tools, also see the one inside the [payma](https://github.com/wildonion/payma) repo.

* complete the **CPI** call from ticket program to whitelist after successful reservation. 

* handle different versions of [hyper](https://hyper.rs/) in `main.rs` using its env var also create a proc macro attribute like `#[passport]` to put on top of the auth controllers.

* complete graphql, redis and websocket routes and controllers setup for realtime strategies like game monitoring, chatapp and push notification also add redis server docker image inside the `docker-compose.yml`.

* sharding and scaling mechanism for `ws` server.

* balance the loads between docker services and images inside the `docker-compose` file using `k8s` on `DigitalOcean` PaaS also CI/CD configuration files based on the latest commits and managing containers using [portainer](https://www.portainer.io/), we could configure `mongodb`, `redis` and `HAproxy` services as a container inside the `DigitalOcean` PaaS.

* complete conse discrod monitoring bot, also run the bot loop `ws` shards based on a specific event inside the app. 

* implement [http proxy](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/blob/master/examples/http_proxy.rs) based on hyper.

* all TODOs inside the app

* backend design pattern sketch using freeform inside wiki.

* communication between Conse and the [coiniXerr](https://github.com/wildonion/uniXerr/tree/master/infra/valhalla/coiniXerr) must be done through the TCP stream since [coiniXerr](https://github.com/wildonion/uniXerr/tree/master/infra/valhalla/coiniXerr) supports TCP stream.

* use an AI model like [STEM](https://github.com/wildonion/stem) which suggests player the tips and tricks for a new game based on behavioural graph of the player collected by the history of each event's `phases` field

* `MMQ` and order matching engine to suggests players events and other games based on their past experiences, scores (MMR) and earned tokens also and order matching engine for players to sell their minted roles based on highest or lowest order in order book.  

* use [uniXerr](https://github.com/wildonion/uniXerr) coin generation AI model which players get rewarded based on their scores and positions which are collected by each event manager inside the game, then update the balance field of the user based on that
