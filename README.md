Conse is an AI based Crypto Game Event Manager Platform on top of [coiniXerr](https://github.com/wildonion/uniXerr/tree/master/infra/valhalla/coiniXerr) blockchain. 

> To update a user access level to dev first signup the user using `/auth/signup` API then run the binary like so: `./app wildonion 0`

## üß™ Test Conse Server

```cargo test --bin conse```

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

```sudo chmod +x app.sh && ./app.sh```

## üöß WIP

* complete conse solana programs inside the `conse` folder using [anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) 

* adding Graphql for realtime streaming using hyper with [juniper](https://graphql-rust.github.io/juniper/master/index.html)

* updating [hyper](https://hyper.rs/) to latest version

* HAProxy, k8s-ing docker containers in `docker-compose.yml` and CI/CD in `app.sh` on [xaas](https://xaas.ir/)

* all TODOs inside the app

* communication between Conse and the [coiniXerr](https://github.com/wildonion/uniXerr/tree/master/infra/valhalla/coiniXerr) must be done through the TCP stream since [coiniXerr](https://github.com/wildonion/uniXerr/tree/master/infra/valhalla/coiniXerr) supports TCP stream.

* use an AI model which suggests player the tips and tricks for a new game based on behavioural graph of the player collected by the history of each event's `phases` field

* use [uniXerr](https://github.com/wildonion/uniXerr) coin generation AI model which players get rewarded based on their scores and positions which are collected by each event manager inside the game, then update the balance field of the user based on that
