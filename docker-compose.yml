  #     Conse Rust Docker Configuration
  #---------------------------------------
  # NOTE - due to the HAproxy DNS resolving 
  #        bug we've commented the following
  #        image since we'll run the rust server
  #        inside the VPS itself and run the HAproxy
  #        inside the docker so we can forward 
  #        rust server packets from the VPS ip
  #        to the specified and opened port 
  #        using HAproxy docker.
  # NOTE - rust dockerfile is useful when 
  #        we want to balance between the loads
  #        of all services using k8s or HAproxy
  #        inside the cloud thus the conse server 
  #        must be dockerized to be balanced 
  #        with high loads using k8s.
