                        ABOUT ctx.data FIELD
                        -------------------- 
        data field in hyper and serenity are atomic types that can be 
        shread between shards' and other threads safely is of type 
        Arc<RwLock<TypeMapKey>> in which TypeMapKey::Value can 
        be of type Arc<Mutex<Data>> and if we want to update the
        type inside the data field we call write() method on the data
        to acquire the lock on the type which during the lock acquisition
        other event handlers remain block until the lock gets released
        also it must be bounded to Sync and Send traits to be safe and
        cloneable to be shared between threads using tokio channels.  

        in Serenity, when handling an interaction_create event, the Interaction 
        object does not directly contain the message instance. The reason is 
        that slash commands can be used without being tied to a specific message.

        in bot design there must be a ctx type that can be passed to other 
        handlers and used to access whole methods and bot setup functions 
        like each ws shard inside each event handler.
