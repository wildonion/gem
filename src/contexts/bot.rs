Several members discuss the risks and losses associated with NFTs. Oxygencube expresses disappointment about their NFT losses and suggests leaving NFTs, while GoatZilla suggests they might have infinite bags that they haven't realized yet. Dead King Dylan advises sticking with two or three projects, while sm0lfish mentions a King who does the same. LC shares an image that generates some laughter, and other members share emoji reactions. Theude mentions a good call he had earlier, and Dead King Dylan observes that he buys every rev share project.
