    write more proc macros like vm inside the lib.rs

    share ownership between threads using Arc by borrowing the ownership using pointers like & clone 
    share ownership between scopes using Rc by  borrwoing the ownership using pointers like & and clone
    Rc is not safe to be used between threads but Arc can be used to share the type between multiple 
    threads safely without having race conditions, also if we want to mutate an immutable type at runtime
    we must use RefCell which is a single threaded smart pointer and for mutating type between multiple 
    threads we must use Mutex or RwLock to avoid deadlocks situations.
    
    Single Thread    Multithread             Usage
    Rc               --> Arc                 make the type shareable between scopes and threads
    RefCell          --> RwLock || Mutex     make the type mutable safe at runtime in scopes and threads

concepts:
    shared ownership, 
    interior mutability, 
    weak, and strong references

Shared ownership
    While the children are owned by the struct, it is necessary to provide access to these 
    children node to other code that use this tree data structure. Moving these references 
    out of the tree isn’t desirable. And cloning the entire node before moving it out of the 
    tree isn’t optimal either. This is where shared onwnership comes into play. In order to 
    do that, we wrap the underlying node in a Rc. This is a reference counted pointer. However, 
    that isn’t enough, since once we pass a (shared) reference to other code (that is using 
        this tree), we need to provide the ability to mutate what is inside the node itself, 
        which leads us to interior mutability.
Interior mutability
    Once a reference (that allows for shared ownership) of a node is passed to code 
    using the tree, it becomes necessary to allow modifications to the underlying node 
    itself. This requires us to use interior mutability by wrapping the node in a 
    RefCell. Which is then wrapped in the Rc that we use to share ownership. Combining 
    these two together gets us to where we need to be.


NodeData
 | | |
 | | +- value: T ---------------------------------------+
 | |                                                    |
 | |                                        Simple onwership of value

 | +-- parent: RwLock<WeakNodeNodeRef<T>> --------+
 |                                            |
 |                 This describes a non-ownership relationship.
 |                 When a node is dropped, its parent will not be dropped.
 |
 +---- children: RwLock<Vec<Child<T>>> ---+
                                          |
                This describes an ownership relationship.
                When a node is dropped its children will be dropped as well.


1 - When a node is dropped, its children will be dropped as well (since it owns them). 
    We represent this relationship w/ a strong reference.

2 - However, the parent should not be dropped (since it does not own them). 
    We represent this relationship w/ a weak reference.
