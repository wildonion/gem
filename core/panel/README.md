## üîë Tiny KYC Identity Verification Process Before Creating CID

> in each verification process 1 token will be given to the user.

- first of all the `/user/login` API must be called to register a new user.
- the second step would be calling the `/user/request-mail-code/{mail}`, `/user/verify-mail-code`, `/user/request-phone-code/{phone}`, `/user/verify-phone-code` APIs to verify the user mail and phone number in order to create the **Crypto Id**.
- then the `/user/cid/build` API must be called to upsert the `username` and `region` fields, it'll create a new **Crypto Id** with the passed in `username` and `device_id`, on the first call and update `username` and `region` field (based on the location of the requested IP address) only on the second call.

## üß¨ Deposit and Withdrawal Process

- mail verification 
- phone verification 
- crypto id (username)
- charge wallet for in-app transactions
- depositor can call `deposit` API to mint nft by spending in-app tokens from his wallet
- withdrawer can call `withdraw` API to transfer nft to recipient to update his in-app token balance

## üé¢ Development Wrapups

* two docker instances of panel service will be built, one contains the postgres and the other mongodb as their database storage framework which are accessible on port **7443** and port **7444** respectively.

* if you want to extend the last table fields first update its `up.sql` file then run ```diesel migration redo``` and finally ```diesel migration run```, to regenerate all tables run ```diesel migration redo -n 3``` which **3** refers to the number of tables we've created so far.

* before migrating any table, make sure that you've an already setup database using ```diesel setup && diesel migration run``` command.

* use ```diesel migration generate <MIGRAION_NAME>``` to create the migration file containing the postgres table setup, ```diesel migration redo``` to drop the table and ```diesel migration run``` to apply all migration tables to the database after submitting changes to the sql fiels.

* to generate a new password for admin and dev users just edit the `tests.rs` code inside the `test` folder then run ```cargo run --bin contest``` to generate those passwords finally update the `up.sql` inside the `migrations/2023-05-22-184005_users` folder to insert a new admin and dev user info into the table when you run ```diesel migration run```.

* two docker instances of panel service will be built, one contains the postgres and the other mongodb as their database storage framework which are accessible on **https://api.panel.conse.app** and **https://api.panel.conse.app/mongo** respectively.

* currently the `/bot/check-users-tasks` API will be called every day at **7 AM** via a setup crontab inside the `jobs` folder to avoid twitter rate limit issue, if you want to change the cron just run `crontab -e` command inside the `jobs` folder and edit the related cron file.

* in order to use twitter APIs you must have a paid developer account and you must use keys and tokens from a twitter developer App that is attached to a project also you can add new keys in `twitter-accounts.json` by calling the `/admin/add-twitter-accounts` API.

* make sure that we're using live stripe keys in `.env` file and we have `https://conse.app/stripe/checkout/success` and `https://conse.app/stripe/checkout/cancel` pages in front-end in order to redirect user to the related page either on a successful stripe checkout payment process or a cancel button event in checkout page, for more see [this](https://github.com/wildonion/gem/tree/master/core/stripewh) README.

* there is an API named `/public/get-token-price/{amount}` which returns the value of the passed in tokens in USD, remember that in order to show the exact amount, the value must gets divided by `100` to extract the floating point format.

* every day at **7 AM** all the users tasks will be checked automatically using a cronjob to see that the user is still verified or not, this will be done by checking all the records of the `users_tasks` table inside the `/check-users-tasks` API. 

* the generated cookie inside the response of the conse panel admin and user login APIs is in form `<JWT>::<SHA256_OF_LOGIN_TIME>`, we can use the first part of `::` sign, as the **JWT** to send authorized requests in postman and swagger UI. 

* in order to reveal the roles of an event, admin **JWT** token generated by the conse mafia hyper server must be passed to the request header of the `/admin/notif/register/reveal-role/{event_objectid}` API inside the panel server, also same as for the dev APIs including `/get/admin/{admin_id}/data` and `/get/user/{user_id}/data`.

* push notification routes for **ECQ**, **MMR** and reveal role topics are `wss://notif.panel.conse.app/subscribe/ecq-{event_objectid}`, `wss://notif.panel.conse.app/subscribe/mmr-{event_objectid}`, `wss://notif.panel.conse.app/subscribe/{user_objectid}/reveal-role-{event_objectid}` respectively and in order to receive realtime role, ecq and mmr notifs data users must use `/join-roles`, `/join-ecq` and `/join-mmr` commands respectively which are used to join the ws channel to create a session once they gets connected, for listening on incoming events (ecq, mmr and reveal role), note that these routes **are guarded with conse mafia JWT** so remember to pass the conse mafia JWT to the header of these routes like `Bearer ...JWT...`, also there is an slash command called `/events` which shows the total online events to the player.
